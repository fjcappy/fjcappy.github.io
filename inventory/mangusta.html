1970 De Tomaso Mangusta –  Yes I know its a project, but not a complicated or rusty one. Unlike most of these cars this one has low original miles (27225) that have been documented with receipts, and this car has never been in an accident.  This is a two headlight car that has had three documented owners from new.  A total of 27225 original documented miles.  An excellent start for a concourse restoration.  I will go into a description of condition, and the parts included below.  I reached out to a known expert in the Mangusta world that was kind enough to look at my pictures and help me judge the good, the bad and the ugly with this car.  Much of what you see below are his observations. I always welcome detailed knowledge.  If you see something in the pictures or have questions please message or call me.  I will probably post your thoughts in the description section of the ad.  The more informed a buyer is the happier I am.  Please remember that we are happy to allow for inspections.  Reach out to me via message or phone and I can arrange the car to be available.
<br><br>
History:
Purchased new in 1970 at Shilling Lincoln Mercury, Memphis TN it has not strayed very far.  The first owner (Webster) averaged about 3000 miles per year in his tenure.  In 1982 Webster had an incident where the back engine wing caught a gust of wind.  The wing blew open resulting in a small crease on the edge of the wing.  Webster demanded the insurance company replaced the wing as apposed to it being repaired.  We have the original panel, and it could go with the car.  While the car was being repaired Webster become engaged.  His future wife gave Webster an ultimatum that he sell the car or she was not going to marry him.  We have notes of this along with the receipts of repairs.  While the car was still at the shop, owner number 2 Jim ( friend of the current owner) stepped in, and he purchased the Mangusta in 1978 with 21868 miles. Jim had the car for a very short time when he brought it to Racing Head Service (R.H.S.) of Memphis for hot rod upgrades.  As per Jim, and the receipts he opted for new Cam(Cam Dynamics), Heads (we believe to be Dan Gurney), Intake, 600 Holly Carburetor, Pertronixs electronic ignition, and custom made headers.  He ordered a high volume fuel pump to feed the thirst of the new carb setup, and was installed it at the same time.  The car will come with the original heads, manifold,  and the original Delco carburetor.  We have all of the receipts and literature for the upgrades.  When Jim finished the car he set about to terrorize Interstate I40 from Hickory Withe to Memphis with his street monster Mangusta.  His total miles driven from his hot rod updates from 1982 to 1987 was 1660.  He register the car for the last time in August 1987, but never drove it past September of 1987.  We have the registration stickers, envelope and registration showing the nupdated plates were never put on the car.  An ex employee of Jim said he would tune up and get it ready to start terrorizing in 1988.  Jim had it brought to the shop.  This gentleman began to move shop to shop bringing the car with him.  Essentially eluding Jim, and making it hard to get the car back.  At the same time Jim’s own company began to find a great deal of success.  With the Mangusta being far down on his list of priorities a great deal of time would pass before eventually Jim hiring a private investigator to find his car.  The car was located and taken back in 2009.  Jim mentioned it to future owner number three, Phillip.  Phillip loved the cars looks, and bought it immediately.  Phillip brought the car to his farm in 2010 with the intention to have it restored.  That day never came to pass.  He has now elected to sell it, and hopes the buyer brings it back to its formal glory.

Body: All of the sheet metal is in primer.  The panels are straight.  The window felts are in good condition.  Some of the rubber is either missing or deteriorated.  The glass is 100% original including a new in the wrapper NOS windshield purchased from Italy in the 80’s. We have much of the assembly screws, but we are sure we do not have all of them required to re assemble the car.  All of the emblems and lights are present and accounted for.  I have pictures in my Google album of the doors which are rust free.  They are still showing the original red paint on the inside and the edges.  The wheel wells are also rust free and clean displaying the factory undercoating.
 <br><br>
Interior: The interior was black from the factory.  The carpet, dash, door panels are all original.  There is a receipt from 9-24-79 where the seats were recovered in black leather.  They show well with minor wear.  The interior is out of the car for painting purposes.  We have many of the trim screws but as previously mentioned we may be missing some items. The steering wheel is the optional leather / wood Ferrero.  The steering wheel leather is in OK shape, but would require refinishing if the car was to be totally restored. The gauges are original with clear glass and clean faces.
 <br><br>
Chassis: The original chassis is in tact including all of the original welds.  The serial number is still clearly stamped into the frame. Spare tire support is still mounted to the chassis.  The hold down bolts do not look to be original, but these were hand built car so they may have renewed.
Engine and Trans axle:  The motor is original to the car.  As previously stated, the cam, heads, manifold,  carburetor and headers were changed in 1982 by R.H.S (still in business).  The original engine parts do come with the car.  We do not have the original ignition coil. The engine has not been started since 1988. The correct original valve covers (non Pantara) and the double snorkel air cleaner are present and in good shape. A new aluminum radiator that we believe was produced by Mangusta International is included with the car.  The gas tank was taken out of the car for painting, but also is included. Exhaust headers are more then Hall Pantara brand, and are in great shape. The following is a quote from my Mangusta expert ” I did not see an alternator.  But what I DID see, was that the RH wing on the bell housing where the alternator should mount, is busted or cut….there should be a rear support for a thru bolt that the alternator would pivot on.   This is slightly disturbing…..also is the what appears to be a busted rear sheave on the Jackshaft rear pulley.” As with most Mangusta’s the alternator was relocated closer to the a/c compressor so the belt could be more stable at high rpm’s.  Please note that Steve did not look at the car itself.  He was looking at pictures, but with that said his observation should be taken in account cause he knows his stuff.  The trans axle is also original.  I have several pics of the bottom of the ZF trans axle that can be seen in the google album.  The trans axle is also original is free of the common “hits” that many endured due to being so low to the ground.  If you want to see the album please message me your email address and I will send an invite.
<br><br>
Documentation / Extras:  Unfortunately we do not have the Jack, Jack Handel, or Tool Roll. We do have a receipt file that will go with the car.  This file is about 3 inches thick. This file includes the original manual signed by Mr. DeTamaso himself that is in great shape.  There are several service and upgrade receipts showing the slowly increasing miles.  There are many handwritten notes that document the vehicles history.  I do have pictures of many of these receipts in the google gallery.
Sale, and Pickup Process:  The monies for the purchase of this car will be handled through the sellers law firm in Tennessee. Money Transfer to the Attorney will be a Wire Transfer. This will include the deposit as well as the final payment.  The title is clear, and ready to be transferred to owner number 4, but only after 100% of the funds are in the firms escrow account.  Due to the fact that this car is a “non runner” that will require packaging and extra care to ship we insist that the buyer make arrangements prior to the purchase. My friend is not a young man.  He is happy to help gather the parts for the car, but packing and shipping is the responsibility of the buyer.  In other words this is a purchase that will require some extra work.  Arrange the help up front. Hire professionals if need be, or bring a trailer…..
