          Two owner car that has been professionally restored to its original specifications utilizing better then factory workmanship. The restoration was completed by a very well knows Arizona restorer.  The engine, transmission, and rear ed where re built at the same time.   It was completed to the exacting specification that the car was delivered new.  The second owner of this beautiful, and rare 390 4 speed car is very close friends with the original owner.  Originally thinking that he would restore the car, and add modern elements the second owner decided to have it restored exactly as delivered.  Eric is owner number 2.  Eric surprised Ed(original owner) with a viewing, and of coarse a long drive.  Ed was chocked up with emotion that his car was exactly as he remembered it when he took delivery.  More on that later.  If you are not a person that is into the history of the car I have a picture link that shows you everything from pre-restoration, through the restoration, and the completed results.  Please message me or call me at 602-908-9267, and I will send it to you. The options on the car are below.  Each still present, and operational.  Please note this car was not ordered as a GT, and the GT items were not added during restoration for accuracy purposes. Please call me with any questions 602-908-9267.

  This Mustang was restored by Desert Classic Mustangs in Tempe Arizona. It was completed in 2017.  This is a very fresh accurate build.   All  of the receipts are available.  I have a google album with all of the documentation that goes with the car.  The receipts detail the hours as well as the items used.  Reproduction items that were used came from Scott Drake.  Scott Drake is known for a much higher quality reproduction part.   Elliot with Desert Classic Mustang tells me that if someone wanted to take this to concours judging status it would not be costly or difficult.  Some of the differences between this car and concours was done for better longevity.  An example would be fully painted control arms as apposed to bare metal.  Another would be a painted drive shaft as apposed to bare.  Most of what would be needed would be stickers, and small grease and paint marking.  Elliot is very proud of this car.  He feels it is one of the best restored, and driving Mustangs he has worked on.   The carburetor and air cleaner are the correct date coded items as is the original radio and speaker that have professionally rebuilt.   I have a few additional items listed that I can discuss that also differ. Elliot is willing to speak to a serious buyer but asks that I tell him when someone is calling so he is not kept away from what he does to make a living, restore Mustangs.  Call me before you call him at 602-908-9267.
